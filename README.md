# ✨ "loopstudios" Landing Page (Frontend Mentor)

![Landing page preview](./design/preview.jpg)

## 📖 Description

Landing page developed with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Styled Components**. This project is part of the Frontend Mentor challenges. I tried to make it as responsive and accessible as possible. The hamburger menu is animated, informs the screen reader about its current state, and is hidden from the user (including tab order and screen readers) when it's closed. It's fully navigable using a keyboard, give it a try!
